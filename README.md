# MATLAB Image Compression Algorithm Web Implementation

## Project Overview
Developed a web-based implementation of an advanced MATLAB image compression algorithm, creating a cross-platform solution accessible via standard web browsers. The project involved translating complex mathematical optimization techniques from MATLAB into client-side JavaScript while maintaining the core binary search methodology for optimal image quality.

## Key Achievements
- Successfully bridged the gap between academic MATLAB code and practical web applications by reimplementing the algorithm in JavaScript
- Created a browser-based solution that eliminates the need for specialized software installation while preserving the original algorithm's functionality
- Designed a user-friendly interface allowing non-technical users to leverage sophisticated image compression techniques
- Implemented client-side processing to ensure user privacy and reduce server infrastructure requirements

## Technical Aspects
- Adapted MATLAB's image processing capabilities to web technologies using the Canvas API and modern JavaScript
- Engineered a binary search optimization algorithm to determine ideal compression parameters
- Maintained compression quality metrics comparable to the original MATLAB implementation
- Developed a responsive interface compatible with multiple device types and screen sizes

## Additional Solutions Designed
- Architected alternative implementation options including:
  - A server-side processing pipeline using MATLAB Runtime
  - A hybrid approach using MATLAB Production Server with web API integration
  - Cross-language implementation strategies for enterprise deployments
